      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to HandyPay (&quot;we,&quot; &quot;our,&quot; or &quot;us&quot;). These Terms of Service
        (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern your use of the HandyPay mobile application and
        payment services. By using our services, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use our
        services.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Payment Services</h2>
      <p>
        HandyPay provides payment processing services through Stripe Connect,
        enabling merchants in Jamaica to accept payments via QR codes and
        digital wallets. Our services are designed for micro and small
        businesses operating in Jamaica.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Merchant Onboarding</h2>
      <p>
        To use our payment services, you must complete Stripe&apos;s merchant
        onboarding process. This includes providing identification documents,
        business information, and bank account details as required by Jamaican
        financial regulations and Stripe&apos;s compliance standards.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Payout Processing</h2>
      <p>
        Payouts are processed through Stripe&apos;s payment infrastructure. Your
        first payout will begin processing 7 days after your account is
        activated and successfully verified. Subsequent payouts are typically
        processed within 2-5 business days, depending on your bank and the
        payment method used.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Fees and Charges</h2>
      <p>
        HandyPay charges a service fee for each transaction processed through
        our platform. Current fees are 2.9% + JMD 30 per transaction. Stripe&apos;s
        standard processing fees also apply. All fees are subject to change
        with 30 days&apos; notice.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Compliance and Regulations</h2>
      <p>
        As a payment service provider operating in Jamaica, we comply with all
        applicable laws and regulations, including those set forth by the Bank
        of Jamaica, the Financial Services Commission, and anti-money
        laundering requirements. You must ensure your business activities
        comply with all Jamaican laws and regulations.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Data Protection</h2>
      <p>
        We collect and process personal data in accordance with our Privacy
        Policy and Jamaican data protection laws. Customer payment data is
        securely handled by Stripe and is not stored on our servers. We use
        industry-standard encryption and security measures to protect your
        information.
      </p>

      <h2>8. Account Responsibilities</h2>

        You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account
        credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You
        must provide accurate and complete information during onboarding and
        keep your business information current.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Prohibited Activities</h2>

        You may not use HandyPay for any illegal activities, including but not
        limited to money laundering, fraud, or transactions involving
        prohibited goods or services under Jamaican law. We reserve the right
        to suspend or terminate your account if we suspect prohibited
        activities.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Termination</h2>
      <p>
        Either party may terminate this agreement at any time. Upon
        termination, you will remain responsible for all outstanding fees and

        Jamaican court system. We encourage users to contact our support team
        first to resolve any issues amicably.
